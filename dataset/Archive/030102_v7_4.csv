Distance between Salon and Factory $= $$850$$-$$750$$ = $$100$$m$    ...([distance between Home & Factory] $-$ [distance between Salon & Home])
Home---$750$$m$--->Salon---$100$$m$--->Factory
As we can see that the distance between Salon and Home is $750$$m$, and the distance between Salon and Factory is $100$$m$.
Since the distance between Salon and Factory $<$ distance between Salon and Home
Factory is nearer to Salon than Home",
